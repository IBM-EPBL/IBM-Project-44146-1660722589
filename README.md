# Problem statement :
Almost everything in our world turned digital like making transactions , payments ,booking tickets ,etc through our handy(mobile phones). Keeping track of our expenses is an important part of managing our overall finances. People having more money donâ€™t have control over spending them in useful manner. This is due to lack of budgeting and saving habit. This make them suffer at money needed situations. Also people are very busy, unable to make entries of their income, expenditure and savings in diaries or data sheets cause they are very time consuming.
# Solution : 
 We have created a web application that helps the user to add expenses on daily/monthly/yearly basis.Most importantly they can set limit for expenses amount.If the user exceeds they will get an email.The application has pie chart representations to show the expenses in daily/monthly/yearly basis.
